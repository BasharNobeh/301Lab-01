1- Created the component and linked them together .
2- faced an issue with linking so I have to export and import some classes .
3- Created more than one object of HornedBeast in The main class .
4- then added the header , main , footer to the app.js file .
5- I used props to control each HornedBeast element components separately.
6- Added the imgs , headers and paraghraps and then deployed the other components .
